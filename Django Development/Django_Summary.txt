Creating Django Project (Step-by-step guide)
    1. For windows - install Python, Pip (Package manager for python) and set PATH (For Linux, python comes as a built-in package)
    2. Open CMD/Terminal and run commands -
        a. pip [pip3 for python 3] install virtualenv
        b. pip [pip3 for python 3] install virtualenvwrapper
    3. Run following command to create a virtual environment
        mkvirtualenv <environment_name>*
    4. Run following command to work on created virtual environment
        workon <environment_name>
    5. Run following command to install Django in the virtual environment
        pip [pip3 for python 3] install Django
    6. Run following command to create a scaffolded project template using django admin tools
        django-admin startproject <project_name>
        - You'll be able to see the project structure
    7. Installing xampp for ubuntu - 
        - Install xampp using installation run package
        - change port number of mysql db, if you've installed some other application which uses same port
    8. Change the database connection properties in settings.py.
    

* If you face "mkvirtualenv: command not found" set the PATH of "virtualenvwrapper.sh" properly in Linux

Issues faced while running the appliation using virtualenvwrapper
1. mkvirtualenv and / or workon: command not found
    - Resolution - run following command
        - source "<path_to_"virtualenvwrapper.sh">"
2. Unable to migrate the db as of now (Getting access denied error) [Last updated on 5/5/2019]
