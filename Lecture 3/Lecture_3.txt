Phases of compilation
1. Tokenization
2. Syntax analysis
3. Semantic analysis
4. Intermediate code generation
5. Code optimization
6. Target code


Python implements automatic garbage collection with reference count mechanism

Python follows reference data model over value data model.

Python distinguishes containers based on type of parantheses.

Python interpreter assigns a memory to integer values ranging from -5 to 256 on startup.

Python Strings - 

1. Indexing of strings start from 0
2. Python does reverse negative indexing.
3. There are no character constants, only string constants in python.
4. String is immutable type.

Slicing of strings - 
1. string[ start_index : end_index [ : step_value ] ]
start_index is inclusive (If not specified, default value is start of the string)
end_index is exclusive (If not specified, default value is end of the string)
step_value is optional with default value 1
