5. Dictionary 

Operators in Python - 
	1. Arity (Unary/Binary)
	2. Precedance (BODMAS rule)
	3. Associativity (All operators except unary and combinational assignments have Left To Right associativity)

	a. Unary
	b. Binary
		1. +,-,*,%
		2. // (Floor division)
		3. ** (Exponential)

	- Returns 'True' or 'False'
	
5. Identity Operators :- 'is' and 'is not'
	- Returns 'True' or 'False'
	
6. Bitwise Operators :-
	- & (Turning off bit(s)) 
	- | (Turning on bit(s))
	- ^ (Toggle bit(s))
	- ~ (Bit inversion)
	- << (Left shift)
	- >> (Arithmetic (for negative numbers (add sign bit)) or Logical Right shift (add 0))
