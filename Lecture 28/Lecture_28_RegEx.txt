Regular Expressions in Python
    - \b => to match empty string but only at start or end of string
    - \d => to match any digit characters
    - \D => to match any non digits characters
    - \s => whitespace characters [\t\n]

Assignments
1. WAP to read input file and read words starting with T/t and ending with E/e from it. [Hint: Use IGNORECASE flag of re module]
2. WAP to accept a filename from user and print all digits from it.


Patterns
1. either a or b => a|b or [ab]
2. a followed by a or b => a[ab]+
3. a followed by a or b non-greedy => a[ab]+?
4. sequences without -,. or space => [^-,.\s]
5. sequences of lowercase letters => [a-z]+
6. sequences of uppercase letters => [A-Z]+
7. one upper case followed by lower case letters => [A-Z][a-z]+

HW Assignments

2. WAP to accept a filename from user and print words having "end" in between them.
3. WAP to accept a filename from user and delete comments from it.
    [Hints]
    - single line comments - starting with # ending with \n, use re.MULTILINE flag
