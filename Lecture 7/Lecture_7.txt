Control Flow -
1. Sequencing
2. Selection (if..else, if...elif...else)
3. Repetition
	- enumeration controlled (for)
	- logically controlled (while)
4. Jump statements
	- break (breaks the repition)
	- continue (it skips the current loop pass and executes next iteration)
	- return (return control to the caller)
5. Functions
6. Recursion

- Python can have main() as an entry point
- Every python script is known as module
- Python interpreter has "__name__" as a global vairable with a default value is "__main__".
- __name__ can be accessed by two ways:
	- as executable (>>>python3 <filename>.py) - __name__ will have '__main__'
	- as reusable module (import <filename>) - __name__ will have 'filename'
