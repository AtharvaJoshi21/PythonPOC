Exception Handling in Python
    - "try...except...else...finally" block
    - "try" for code script under evaluation
    - "except" for catching exceptions
    - "else" for excuting a code script if no exception has occurred
    - "finally" block will be executed ALWAYS. If any "except" block is not there, "finally" block MUST BE present.
    - "raise" for throwing an exception
    - e.g.
        try:
            <code_under_evaluation>
        except <exceptionType> as <alias>:
            <exception_processing_code>
    - Specialized exceptions MUST BE handled before generalized
        - e.g. NameError must be handled before Exception
